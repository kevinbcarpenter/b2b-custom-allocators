Stack and arena-based memory allocators offer significant advantages in C++ for efficient and controlled memory management:
	1.	High Performance: Both allocators are exceptionally fast. Stack allocators work in a LIFO order, requiring only pointer adjustments for allocation and deallocation. Arena allocators preallocate large memory blocks and serve smaller allocations from these, reducing overhead and improving performance. This predictability is crucial for real-time and performance-critical systems.
	2.	Reduced Fragmentation: These allocators avoid memory fragmentation by allocating memory linearly (stack) or from a predefined block (arena). This is especially important for systems with limited memory, such as embedded devices or GPUs, ensuring efficient memory usage without gaps.
	3.	Scoped Lifetime Management: Stack allocators automatically free memory when a scope is exited, simplifying lifetime management. Arena allocators allow batch deallocation of all memory within the arena, eliminating the need for tracking individual allocations and calling delete or free.
	4.	Customization: Both allocators provide precise control over memory management. Developers can tailor memory pools, chunk sizes, and allocation strategies to match application needs. This flexibility is invaluable in specialized domains like embedded systems or high-performance computing.
	5.	Cache Efficiency: Allocating memory contiguously improves cache locality. Stack allocators keep related variables close in memory, enhancing cache hits. Arena allocators similarly optimize memory access patterns, benefiting containers like std::vector and applications requiring frequent memory operations.

These characteristics make stack allocators ideal for temporary data within a function or thread and arena allocators perfect for high-frequency allocation scenarios like object pools or simulations. Both approaches minimize overhead and ensure predictable, efficient memory handling.
